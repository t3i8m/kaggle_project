# Kaggle ML Projects

This repository contains a collection of my machine learning projects and tutorials based on datasets from Kaggle and other sources.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

Each folder is a separate project or tutorial:

- `customer_segmentation_clustering/`  
  Clustering analysis of customer data using K-Means and Agglomerative Clustering.

- `education_career_analysis/`  
  Exploratory data analysis and prediction tasks related to education and career data.

- `k-Means_clustering_tutorial/`  
  Simple tutorial on implementing and visualizing K-Means clustering.

- `kNN_classifier_tutorial/`  
  Notebook demonstrating k-Nearest Neighbors classification on sample data.

- `linear_regression_tutorial/`  
  Basics of linear regression using synthetic or real-world data.

- `logistic_regression_tutorial/`  
  Classification tasks using logistic regression.

- `movie_recommendation_system/`  
  Building a simple movie recommendation system.

- `predicting_house_prices_decision_trees/`  
  Using decision trees to predict house prices based on real estate features.

- `svm_classifier_tutorial/`  
  Working with Support Vector Machines for classification tasks.

- `titanic_competition/`  
  Kaggle Titanic survival prediction challenge.

## ðŸ“¦ Datasets

All datasets used in these projects are stored in the `data/` subfolders of each project.

## âœ… How to Use

1. Open any `.ipynb` notebook file in Jupyter or VS Code.
2. Install required Python packages if needed.
3. Run the cells step by step and explore the outputs.

## ðŸ’¡ Notes
